In order to create a login form in Java, we have to follow the following steps:

Create a class that uses the JFrame and ActionListener to design the login form and perform the action.
Create user interface components using swings and awt and add them to the panel.
Override the actionPerformed() method that will call on the button click.
In this method, we will verify the user entered credentials.
Create a new page using JFrame and navigate the user to it if the credentials are authentic.
Else show an error message to the user.
